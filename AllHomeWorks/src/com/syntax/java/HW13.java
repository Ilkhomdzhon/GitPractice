//		Math Magic
//		In this project, you will become a magician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you created.
//
//		For you to do:
//
//		Create an int variable called myNumber. Set it equal to any number other than 0.
//		We will refer to myNumber as the original number from now on.
//		Create an int variable called stepOne. Set it equal to the original number (myNumber) multiplied by itself.
//		Create an int variable called stepTwo. Set it equal to the previous result (stepOne) plus the original number (myNumber).
//		Create an int variable called stepThree. Set it equal to the previous result (stepTwo) divided by the original number.
//		Create an int variable called stepFour. Set it equal to the previous result (stepThree) plus 17.
//		Create an int variable called stepFive. Set it equal to the previous result (stepFour) minus the original number.
//		Create an int variable called stepSix.Set it equal to the previous result (stepFive) divided by 6.
//		Let's print out the value of the last step as: "The magic number is _ !"
//		Now try running your code! What number is printed to the console?
//		Now, go back to your code and change myNumber to any other integer. 
//		Run your program again.
//		Is the output the same? 
//		It's math magic!
//
//		Output:
//		"The magic number is _!"

		System.out.println("The magic number is "+stepSix);
